You can read about the project here: http://41j.com/blog/2011/09/msp430-watch/

This code is probably woefully broken. You need to comment/uncomment code depending on the lcd type (3310 or 3530)

sudo apt-get install mspdebug gcc-msp430

To build:

make msp430watch.elf

To program the code:

sudo make msp430watch.program
